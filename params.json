  "body": "# Shutdown Wizard\r\n\r\nShutdown or hibernate your machine in a certain amount of time.\r\n\r\nCurrently, only Windows is supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nIt's a two-step process. In the first step, you choose to either shutdown or hibernate your machine by pressing either the `S` or `H` key. Step two is the time to wait, in hours.\r\n\r\nOnce countdown has started, it'll display the time left and the action.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nFirst, clone the repository to a folder on your machine.\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/patatjenl/shutdown-wizard.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecondly, create the launcher.\r\n- Right-click the file, choose `Create shortcut`\r\n\r\nOptional: If your account isn't an administrator:\r\n- Right-click the shortcut, choose `Properties`\r\n- Click the `Advanced...` button\r\n- Check the `Run as administrator` checkbox\r\n- Click the `Ok` button for both opened screens\r\n\r\nOptional: Choose a cool icon\r\n- Right-click the shortcut, choose `Properties`\r\n- Click the `Change Icon...` button\r\n- Select the icon of your choice\r\n- Click the `Ok` button for both opened screens\r\n\r\nOptional: Add to Windows 10 Start Menu\r\n- Press `Start + R` on your keyboard\r\n- Type: `%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs`\r\n- Paste the shortcut you've created in the previous steps in there\r\n- Optionally set as tile by opening the start menu, then finding the shortcut on the left list. Right-click and choose `Pin to Start`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Future\r\n\r\n- I'd like to support Linux and MacOS as well.\r\n- Being able to select more hour options (not just 1-9)\r\n- Having a shortcut out of the box\r\n- Make it look good\r\n",
